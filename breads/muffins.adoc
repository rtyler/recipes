=== Directions

[NOTE]
====
If mixing with a stand mixer, use a low and constant speed.
====

. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let activate for a
  minute or two.
. Mix in dry milk, sugar, salt, oil/shortening/lard, and two cups of flour.
. Once mixed in, slowly mix in sourdough starter.
. Replace mixing paddle with kneading hook and slowly add the remainder of the
  flour while kneading at a low speed for roughly 10 minutes. The dough should
  be sticky and smooth; expect it to be a bit more liquid than a bread dough.
. Scrape the dough down off the sides of the bowl, cover and place in a warm
  place for one to two hours (until doubled in size).
. Gently deflate and let rest for 10 minutes.
. Lightly sprinkle farina/semolina onto two or three baking sheets.
. Pour out onto floured board, cut pieces off and hand-roll into 3 inch diameter
  balls.
. Place balls onto baking sheets, gently flattening each in its place.
. Cover with parchment paper and let sit in a warm place for 30-60 minutes
  until they have puffed up a bit.
. Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium heat.
. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with more farina/semolina.
. Gently place onto griddle and let cook for 7-15 minutes per side; internal
  temperature should read 200&deg;F.
. Let cool fully on a cooling rack before eating.


[TIP]
====
Use a fork to separate the english muffins to preserve the nooks and crannies
on the inside of the muffin.
